        Blacklist runs before the synapse data has been deserialized (i.e. before synapse.data is available).
        The synapse is instead contracted via the headers of the request. It is important to blacklist
        requests before they are deserialized to avoid wasting resources on requests that will be ignored.

                            and a string providing the reason for the decision.

        This function is a security measure to prevent resource wastage on undesired requests. It should be enhanced
        to include checks against the metagraph for entity registration, validator status, and sufficient stake
        before deserialization of synapse data to minimize processing overhead.
